# Safe-Lock
It's an app that can crypt and uncrypt stuff. The "store" operation crypts strings and stores them in file attaching keywords to them so it can be later searched (good for password storing)


### Release version : SafePadRelease.zip (in the same folder with the source-code)
If you encounter any problems delete the "data.cbdat" file
